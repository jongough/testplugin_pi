Plugin to test JSON and ODAPI and develop a templated build system

The idea is really to debug the process to see what happens. 
The testplugin should 'do' what a plugin would do to create stuff, 
i.e. it is a working example, 
and it allows me to test the API without having to drive another plugin.

Only ODAPI is working at the moment. JSON is being developed now.

1. With the ODAPI select the type of object you want to create, 
2. click on the chart to pick the click location for its creation or provide the lat/lon, 
3. then click create. 
4. The object 'should' be created.

The templated build process is known and FrontEnd 2 (FE2), which simplifies the information needed to build a plugin to the 
CMakeLists.txt file for most builds. All the other files needed for a plugin are supplied to allow automated building
of the current environments supported by OpenCPN. The templated system allows for extensions per plugin to be addede by the
developer. 

NOTE this is currently a work in progress and should be considered 'Alpha/Beta'. It may have issues at times as new functionality is added. It is a test tool not a production plugin.
